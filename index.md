# Logo

Koku, in Japanese, is a unit of measure for the amount of rice sufficient for one person for one year. Masu is a square wooden box for measuring rice, and more recently for drinking sake. Along the themes of measurement and management of resources, we present you the Koku logo of a Masu box measuring the rice cloud.
